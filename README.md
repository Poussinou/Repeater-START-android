# Repeater-START-android
An Android port of the Linux open repeater offline repeater database app.

Currently mostly working beta.

What works:
* Offline cache of hearham.com repeaters
* Browse Mapbox map, online or offline.
* Search for peaks or areas

What doesn't work:
* What3words API
* Locate me button (however the default is to center your location)
* Marking the center of the map as the selected area and point that the repeater distance is calculated from.
