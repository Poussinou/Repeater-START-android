Repeater-START (Showing The Amateur Repeaters Tool) is the only open-source app utilizing the open-data repeater project at hearham.live.

This is the Android port of the Linux app that lets you see the repeaters on a map and on a list, sorted nearest first.

Once updated, the app works online or offline.
