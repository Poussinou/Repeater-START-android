Thank you for your interest in contributing to Repeater-START.

All code contributions should be in Java for Android Studio, and names of buttons and ui elements must match
the standard desktop app's naming where applicable, this should make any updates simpler.

If you add a feature please consider adding it to the desktop app as well.

The standard desktop application is available at:
